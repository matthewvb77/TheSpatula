TheSpatula
Web Scraping Toolbox For Stock Research

Goal-> To predict stocks that are about to boom, whether this boom is brief or long-term.

Current Steps:

1) Use reddit_scraper for bulk data collection, this will update the "TheSpatula.reddit" Table with MySQL
2) Once you have found a handful of stocks of interest, use youtube_scraper for more pointed data, this will update the "TheSpatula.youtube" Table
3) Create graphs, with 'interest in stock' overlayed with price.
4) Feed info into linear regression model?
